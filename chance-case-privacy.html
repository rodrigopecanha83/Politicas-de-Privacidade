    <h1>Privacy Policy for the Extension:<br> "Chance Case Chrome Extension"</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 12, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the Google Chrome extension "Chance Case Chrome Extension" (hereinafter referred to as the "Extension") handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or browsing data of the user.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The functionality of the Extension is performed entirely within your local browser. It is designed for a single purpose: **to read the text saved on your clipboard and rewrite it to the same location with the chosen capitalization format (Capitalize, Title Case, UPPERCASE, or lowercase).** No information from your clipboard or browsing activity is sent to external servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Required Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        To function correctly, the Extension requests the following permissions in Google Chrome. Below, we explain why each one is necessary:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>clipboardRead and clipboardWrite:</strong> These permissions are essential for the main function of the Extension. **clipboardRead** is required to read the text currently copied by the user. **clipboardWrite** is required to write the formatted text back to your operating system's clipboard.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically to stay informed.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
